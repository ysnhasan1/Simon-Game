# Simon-Game

Creating a simon game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

## About The Project

* In this project I wanted to create a Simon Game. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
The "Simon Game" is a memory and pattern recognition game where 
players need to repeat a sequence of colors or tones that the game generates. 

## How to play?

* The game contains buttons with 4 different colors as seen in the screenshots below.
When you click the "PLAY" button to play the game, a random color is selected and appears with its own animation and special sound.
Then you have to click on this randomly selected color.
When you make the wrong choice, "Game Over!" message appears on the screen and the game is over. </br>
You can restart the game by clicking the "RESTART" button.
If you choose the right color, you can see your level increase by 1.
Now a random color is selected again, it appears with animation and its own special sound.
You have to be careful here.
You should remember the first color and click it and then click the second color respectively. The game continues in this way. </br>
You can click on the link below to understand the game better and have some fun. 
Feel free to share your highest level with me.
